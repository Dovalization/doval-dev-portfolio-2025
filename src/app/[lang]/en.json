      "Hi! I'm Guilherme Doval—I turn ambitious visions into technology people can rely on.",
      "Eight years ago, I was building game worlds where every design decision shaped how players experienced the gameplay. Today, I build web applications where every decision shapes how teams get work done. What connects them? Understanding that technology isn't just about functionality—it's about creating experiences that feel intuitive to the people using them.",
      "My Master's research on interface design and user psychology revealed something crucial: interfaces don't just provide functionality—they create meaning and emotional connection. I studied how game user interfaces could increase player immersion, even when they were technically 'harder to use'. This taught me that the psychological experience of using a system matters as much as its efficiency.",
      "This research background changes how I approach every project. While most developers optimize for usability metrics, I understand when to balance efficiency with engagement. I can see when a technical decision will affect how users relate to the system, or when a stakeholder's vision actually aligns with creating better user experiences.",
      "I handle the complete process: stakeholder interviews, user research, system architecture, implementation, and deployment. But what sets me apart is connecting these pieces through an understanding of how people actually process and relate to technology. I don't just build what stakeholders ask for—I research what users actually need, then build systems that work for both the business and the people using them.",
      "The result? Technology that teams don't just use, but rely on. Systems that feel intuitive because they're built around how people naturally think and work."
