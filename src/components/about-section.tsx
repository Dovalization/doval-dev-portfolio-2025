          Hi! I'm Guilherme Doval, a full-stack developer and designer based in
          Brasil. I specialize in building systems that make people's lives
          easier.
        </p>
        <p className="text-light-primary leading-6">
          I don't build products that box people in. I build tools that give
          them clarity, control, and the freedom to act. I've felt firsthand how
          systems can scatter focus and push the urgent over the important.
        </p>
        <p className="text-light-primary leading-6">
          So I design software that fits how people actually think: fast to use,
          simple to maintain, easy to change, and built for momentum. When
          technology supports clarity and efficiency, people don't just use it â€”
          they rely on it. And that's the kind of work I believe is worth
          building.
        </p>
