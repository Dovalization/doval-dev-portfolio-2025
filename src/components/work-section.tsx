Focused on rapid feature delivery to unlock capabilities early and gather stakeholder feedback, with extensive testing and code reviews to ensure team reliability.",

        Each project taught me something different about translating stakeholder
        vision into working systems. Some required deep technical optimization,
        others needed careful UX research, and a few demanded both. Here&apos;s
        how I approached the challenges:
