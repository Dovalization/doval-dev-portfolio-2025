excerpt: "Wittgenstein said the meaning of a word is its use in the language. This project takes that literally: 240 books, 27 million words, 200 years — training word embeddings per decade to trace how 'representation', 'agent', 'network', and 27 other terms actually moved through the written record."

> "If we say 'Every word in language signifies something' we have so far said nothing whatever; unless we have explained exactly what distinction we wish to make. For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language."
>
> — Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations* §43 (1953)

The meaning of a word changes over time. "Network" in 1950 meant something to a communication engineer — in 1980 it meant something to a sociologist — in 2015 it meant something to a machine learning researcher. These aren't the same word being applied to different things — the concept itself has drifted, carrying different assumptions, different neighbours, different implications each time.

I've been sitting with this observation for a while, mostly because I work at the intersection of design, technology, and I'm an avid reader. I keep noticing how the same terms — representation, agent, model, affordance, intelligence — circulate across disciplines as if they mean the same thing, when they clearly don't.

So I started building interpretant — a tool for tracing semantic drift across the written record of the last 200 years. The name comes from Peirce: the interpretant is the third element of the sign relation, the meaning a sign produces in a mind. Not fixed or arbitrary — contextual, relational and always in motion.

The idea is simple in theory: train word embedding models on texts from each decade, align the resulting vector spaces so word positions are comparable across time. Then observe how the neighbourhood of a word shifts — which terms cluster around it, which drift away, when a concept jumps fields.

## The corpus

Before any modelling can happen, we'll need text — a lot of it.

I made a deliberate choice early on: this would be a curated corpus, not a scraped one. The anchor layer is a hand-picked library of primary texts spanning philosophy, cognitive science, AI, design, media theory, sociology, and critical theory. Alongside it, three bulk academic sources cover the scientific literature from the 1960s onward: PubMed (30.5 million abstracts, 1960–2020), the ACL Anthology (90k NLP papers, 1965–2020), and arXiv (112k papers, 1991–2020).

The selection criterion for the books is: does this text bear directly on the words I care about? The 30 words of interest fall across five clusters:

- **Philosophy of mind**: consciousness, representation, embodiment, intentionality, perception, experience, understanding, mind
- **AI / CS**: intelligence, learning, network, attention, agent, memory, reasoning
- **Design**: affordance, interface, feedback, form, user, pattern
- **Arts / culture**: image, simulation, medium, signal
- **Cross-field**: information, behavior, model, complexity, symbol

The corpus is designed to create collisions. Hegel and Sutton & Barto sit in the same training data because both are about how representations form and update — separated by 180 years and entirely different vocabularies, but adjacent in the conceptual space I'm trying to map.

The corpus spans every decade from the 1820s to the 2010s — a 200-year window, 240 books, ~27M words total:

| Decade | Books | Words |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 1820s | 3 | 0.6M |
| 1830s | 5 | 0.4M |
| 1840s | 8 | 1.0M |
| 1850s | 5 | 0.5M |
| 1860s | 5 | 0.5M |
| 1870s | 6 | 1.0M |
| 1880s | 8 | 0.8M |
| 1890s | 6 | 1.0M |
| 1900s | 13 | 1.5M |
| 1910s | 13 | 1.1M |
| 1920s | 17 | 1.7M |
| 1930s | 10 | 1.3M |
| 1940s | 14 | 1.6M |
| 1950s | 16 | 1.3M |
| 1960s | 24 | 3.1M |
| 1970s | 20 | 2.0M |
| 1980s | 21 | 2.5M |
| 1990s | 22 | 2.6M |
| 2000s | 12 | 1.4M |
| 2010s | 12 | 1.2M |

The 1820s–1950s are books-only — the scientific corpora don't reach that far back. That's intentional. The books layer is doing different work in those decades: establishing the philosophical vocabulary that the later scientific literature will either inherit, contest, or silently overwrite.

## What building the corpus actually involved

More work than expected.

The sourcing was layered: public domain texts fetched automatically from Project Gutenberg and Internet Archive; open access PDFs from Monoskop, Marxists.org, and author sites; and a long tail of manually sourced PDFs, EPUBs, and DjVu files covering most of the continental philosophy, critical theory, and cognitive sciences.

Extraction was the hard part. The pipeline uses PyMuPDF for born-digital files and Docling — an ML-based OCR pipeline — for scanned PDFs. In practice this meant dealing with: font-encoded PDFs that look extractable but return binary garbage; scan detection based on average characters per page; stripping image-tag artifacts from Docling output; and fixing soft-hyphen line-breaks across dozens of books where OCR had split words mid-token.

The worst case was a PDF that returned 82% binary control characters due to a custom font encoding — the working extraction came from a DjVu version of the same book. 188,000 words, eventually.

Every book has a manifest entry with full provenance: author, year, decade, field tags, source URL, and copyright status. The manifest is also how the pipeline validates coverage — if an entry has no corresponding extracted text file, validation fails.

## The pipeline

Five stages, each a CLI command:

1. `corpus preprocess` — decade-slices texts into flat files, one document per line
2. `embed train` — trains a Word2Vec or FastText model per decade
3. `twec train` — trains temporally aligned embeddings using the compass method
4. `drift compute` — cosine distance, neighbourhood shift (Jaccard on top-25 neighbours), and average pairwise distance across consecutive decades
5. `app` — Streamlit dashboard: trajectory plots, nearest-neighbour comparisons, drift heatmaps

The alignment step is the methodologically load-bearing one.

The original plan was orthogonal Procrustes rotation — map each decade's independently trained embedding space onto a shared reference. It works, but it has a structural problem for a corpus with this kind of temporal asymmetry: Procrustes aligns by minimising squared distance over a shared vocabulary. For early decades with only a handful of books, that shared vocabulary with the 2010s reference is thin. The rotation is technically valid but the estimates are high-variance.

The replacement is TWEC — Temporal Word Embeddings with a Compass (Di Carlo et al., 2019). Instead of training each decade independently and rotating after, TWEC trains a single compass model on all decades' text concatenated, establishing a universal coordinate system. Each decade model is then initialised from the compass and trained with its context vectors frozen to compass values. The result: decade models are born aligned. No post-hoc rotation, because the shared frame was baked in during training.

This matters most at the edges. The 1820s model has very few observations, but its geometry is constrained by the same context matrix as the 2020s model. Sparse decades will have lower-confidence positions — fewer co-occurrence counts, wider effective confidence intervals on any given word's location — but they're grounded in the same space rather than rotated into it after the fact.

## What I expect to find

Working hypothesis: contested terms — words that circulate across disciplines with divergent meanings — will show higher distributional instability than field-specific technical terms. "Representation" should have higher neighbourhood variance across decades than "mitochondria."

The AI/CS vocabulary didn't emerge from nowhere. "Agent", "learning", "model", "network" have long pre-histories in cybernetics, philosophy of mind, and sociology. The drift analysis should show the moment those pre-histories get overwritten — the decade where "network" stops being Castells and starts being backpropagation.

I should get the first results soon.
